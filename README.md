# Google V8 Binaries

### Version 5.7.0 (Candidate)

Binaries are compiled with Visual Studio 2013, built with [GN](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Building%20with%20GN). The directorynames of this repository tell which GN configuration I used for those binaries (except for 'include', which just stores header files).
